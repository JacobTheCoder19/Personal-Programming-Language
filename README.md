<h2><em>✨ Purpose / Inspiration ✨</em></h2>
&emsp;The inspiration for this project came from a goal I had when I first became really passionate about programming. I always thought that it would be awesome to develop my own programming language and be able to understand programming at that advanced of a level. So, I took a class about the structure of programming languages where I am learning more and more about how they work and how to make my own. This language is a cool project of mine where I take what I am learning in that class and then use it to build this language of mine. This language was named after one of my favorite movie series of all time, The Matrix. I choose to make the file type in which the language is stored in a .jg since those are my initials for my name. This project may not be completely done yet but I am working on it every week to hopefully be just as good as python or other popular languages!

<h2><em>⚙️ How it works ⚙️</em></h2>

&emsp;The Matrix programming language is designed to be simple and user-friendly. Users can write code in a text file with a `.jg` extension, using a straightforward syntax that includes arithmetic operations and output commands. 

&emsp;To execute a program, users run the `Matrix` script from the command line, passing the filename as an argument (e.g., `./Matrix test.jg`). The interpreter reads the code, tokenizes it, parses it into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using recursive descent parsing, and evaluates the expressions to produce output.

&emsp;To run the language so your terminal accepts it, first make it an executable by doing "chmod +x Matrix". Then you should be able to do "./Matrix FILENAME.jg" to run your program 

&emsp;Also, The ";" is a statement separator and not a statement terminator. That way the user doesn't need one on the last line of code. Think of it like when using numbers or variables in an array [1,2,3,4] You don't have a "," at the end because it is a statement seperator and not a statement terminator. My language follows the same principle but with the ";" because it makes more sense to me and makes it easier to not forget a semicolon when I think of them as just seperating statements.

&emsp;Error handling is built into the interpreter, providing users with feedback on syntax errors or runtime issues, which helps them learn and debug their code effectively. Overall, Matrix is a simple yet powerful tool for anyone looking to explore the world of programming.
