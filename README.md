<h2><em>✨ Purpose / Inspiration ✨</em></h2>
&emsp;The inspiration for this project came from a goal I had when I first became really passionate about programming. I always thought that it would be awesome to develop my own programming language and be able to understand programming at that advanced of a level. So, I took a class about the structure of programming languages where I am learning more and more about how they work and how to make my own. This language is a cool project of mine where I take what I am learning in that class and then use it to build this language of mine. This language was named after one of my favorite movie series of all time, The Matrix. I choose to make the file type in which the language is stored in a .jg since those are my initials for my name. This project may not be completely done yet but I am working on it every week to hopefully be just as good as python or other popular languages!

<h2><em>⚙️ How it works ⚙️</em></h2>

&emsp;The Matrix programming language is designed to be simple and user-friendly. Users can write code in a text file with a `.jg` extension, using a straightforward syntax that includes arithmetic operations and output commands. 

&emsp;To execute a program, users run the `matrix` script from the command line, passing the filename as an argument (e.g., `./matrix test.jg`). The interpreter reads the code, tokenizes it, parses it into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using recursive descent parsing, and evaluates the expressions to produce output.

&emsp;The language supports basic features such as arithmetic operations, allowing users to perform calculations. The `display` command is used to print output to the console, making it easy to see the results of computations.

&emsp;Error handling is built into the interpreter, providing users with feedback on syntax errors or runtime issues, which helps them learn and debug their code effectively. Overall, Matrix is a simple yet powerful tool for anyone looking to explore the world of programming.
